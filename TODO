core:
=====

    - support for packages as commands
    - better ways to test
    - tests for new features (options)
    - more examples in /examples
    - improving shell and abbrev plugin
    - maybe an error/exception handling class [al newkirk]
    - maybe a cmd usage help guide can be thrown on error


plugins:
========

    - App::Rad::Plugin::Log4perl  (work in progress by mvitor)
    - App::Rad::Plugin::Menu  (work in progress by gabriel vieira)
    - App::Rad::Plugin::Daemon (?) something to easily daemonize, get pids, ...?
    - App::Rad::Plugin::Autoconf  (register "x" option and get "--with-x", "--no-x", etc, just like autoconf)

    - a plugin to create getters/setters as commands?

    - maybe also something for...
        Authentication/Authorization
        Localization/Internationalization


other:
======

    - maybe there's a way to recongnize a program as an App::Rad program and let users autocomplete on *nix via /etc/bash_completion (could be worth investigating)

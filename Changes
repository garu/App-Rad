Revision history for App-Rad

1.05	2009/05/
		* Added examples
		Added initial Shell-like behavior support via 'App::Rad->shell'

1.04	2009/05/04

		***MINOR API CHANGE*** => default is now to register only subs that do *not* start with an underscore

		Fixed documentation (bug reported by FCO)
		Single (no value) options are now stored in $c->options with '1' value, so you don't have to explicitly use 'defined' to test them.
		Increment single options' value if argument is passed more than one time (so -v -v will make $c->options->{v} == 2)
		Now configuration files can have whole strings as options
		Now $c->cmd is an lvalue and can be changed w/o fiddling with internals
		Added CONTRIBUTORS section in POD
		Updated test suite

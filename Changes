Revision history for App-Rad

1.05_01	2009/08/

        *** KNOWN BUG *** 
		@ARGV is left unchanged. As a result, $c->getopt no longer works. 
		This should be fixed by the time 1.05 comes out.
		******************

		*** API CHANGE *** 
		$c->execute does not call 'default' or 'invalid' commands anymore if
        it can't find the command name. Rad itself still does, but via 
        parse_input. You don't have to worry about this unless you make 
        explicit calls to $c->execute.
		******************

		*** API CHANGE *** 
		** (also note we are voting invalid() for complete removal  **
		** if you can't live without it, please email me or join us **
		** in #app-rad at irc.perl.org )                            **
		**************************************************************
		if you redefine invalid(), note the invalid command is no longer
		passed as $c->cmd. This was inconsistent, being it's not an actual
		command. Now, the invalid subroutine receives 2 arguments: $c and
		the offending command, so you can do:
		
		sub invalid {
		    my ($c, $invalid_command) = (@_);
		    ...
		}
		
		all other subroutines keep receiving just $c as argument.
		******************

		*** API CHANGE *** 
		the rarely used create_command_name() method was removed from Rad, or
		rather -moved- into App::Rad::Include, so if you have code using that,
		just change your calls from $c->create_command_name() to 
		App::Rad::Include::create_command_name($c)
		But you most likely never even heard of it, so don't worry.
		******************
		
	
        $c->path and $c->realpath new auxiliary methods for giving you the
        app's bin path and realbin path (via FindBin core module) - 
		Added initial Shell-like behavior support via 'App::Rad->shell'
		Added support for defining specific command arguments and its attributes 
		(thanks ZOSO for suggesting, everybody at #app-rad for discussing its API, 
		and FCO for implementing the first patch)
		Fixed bug where --option=0 was being set to 1 and not to 0, as expected (FCO)
		Created experimental App::Rad::Tester to help testing apps created with Rad.
		Updated documentation
		
		Added dynamic type setting for values that are set automatically [al newkirk]
		Added default value support for argument options default setting [al newkirk]
		Added argument conflict detection [al newkirk]
		Added stash storing support [al newkirk]
		Updated alias support [al newkirk]

1.04	2009/05/04

		***MINOR API CHANGE*** => default is now to register only subs that do *not* start with an underscore

		Fixed documentation (bug reported by FCO)
		Single (no value) options are now stored in $c->options with '1' value, so you don't have to explicitly use 'defined' to test them.
		Increment single options' value if argument is passed more than one time (so -v -v will make $c->options->{v} == 2)
		Now configuration files can have whole strings as options
		Now $c->cmd is an lvalue and can be changed w/o fiddling with internals
		Added CONTRIBUTORS section in POD
		Updated test suite

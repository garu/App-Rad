=head1 NAME

App::Rad::Help - 'help' command extension for App::Rad

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.02

=head1 SYNOPSIS

you can add inline help for your App::Rad commands via C<< $c->register() >> or C<< $c->register_commands() >>:

    use App::Rad;
    App::Rad->run();
    
    sub setup {
        my $c = shift;
        
        $c->register_commands( {
                foo => 'expand your foo!',
                bar => 'have a drink! arguments: --drink=DRINK',
            });
            
        $c->register('baz', \&baz, 'do your thing');
    }
    
you can also do it with the attribute 'Help' in your subs

    sub my_command :Help(this is my command) {
        ...
    }
    
    sub another_cmd
    :Help(yet another command)
    {
        ...
    }

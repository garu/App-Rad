=head1 NAME

App::Rad::Plugin::Abbrev - Abbreviate your App::Rad commands

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

myapp.pl:

    use App::Rad qw(Abbrev);
    App::Rad->run;

	sub mycmd { return "Hello!" }

And from the command line:

    > ./myapp.pl m
	Hello!
	> ./myapp.pl my
	Hello!
	> ./myapp.pl myc
	Hello!
	> ./myapp.pl mycm
	Hello!
	> ./myapp.pl mycmd
	Hello!

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin lets you abbreviate your command names when calling them (as long as there is no ambiguity - see below). This is useful when you have a long command name and not too much patience to type it :)

=head2 $c->execute( I<COMMAND_NAME> );

This plugin overrides Rad's C<execute> method. The new one will work exactly like the former, but will expand abbreviated command names whenever they are ambiguous.

Suppose you have:

   sub command  { ... }
   sub command2 { ... }
   sub yet_another_command { ... }

This is the expected behavior:

   $c->execute('yet');     # same as $c->execute('yet_another_command')
   $c->execute('com');     # ambiguous call, so falls to invalid command
   $c->execute('command'); # not ambiguous, as it's a direct hit


=head2 $c->get_commands_like( I<ABBREVIATED_COMMAND_NAME> )

This plugin also creates a new method that returns a list of valid commands that expand from the given abbreviation. If no commands match, returns an empty list.
